                    <p> Learning to code is really just about learning how to give instructions to (and understand replies from) different kinds of machines and computer programs - in a language they can understand. The basic idea is not very different from helping a toddler learn to eat with a spoon or pick up their toys - we teach them combinations of simple steps that let them eventually do things on their own. <span class="green_text read_more stacks">Read more...</span></p>

                    <p><span class="hidden_content stacks"><br>Just as humans aren't born with the skills to talk to each other, coders aren't born with the skills to talk to machines. We have to learn and practice the languages and words we need to do the things we want, and our language changes depending on who or what we're talking to. Apps and website uses a bunch of different programs and machines to function - all <b>stacked</b> up in a specific order, with a way to communicate between each other (sometimes over a very long distance).</span></p>

                    <p><span class="hidden_content stacks"><br>Sometimes, professional coders specialize in just part of this stack of machines and languages. The people who are really good at talking to the machines closest to your eyes and fingers when you're using an app are called <b>"front end"</b> developers. They speak <b>"client-side"</b> languages filled with instructions for how to make things show up on a screen and react to your movements. The people who talk to the machines that hold the central brains of the app or website are called <b>"back-end"</b> developers, and they speak "server-side" languages that know how to do calculations, dig back into memory, and pass information along to the front end.</span></p>

                    <p><span class="hidden_content stacks"><br>Code for Progress teaches "full stack" app development, which means we teach the languages that coders need to talk to both the front end and the back end of the app or website's stack, plus a couple of <b>'frameworks"</b>, which are tools that coders use to make the front end and back end talk to each other easily and efficiently. Our front-end languages are HTML, CSS, and JavaSript. Our back-end languages are Python and SQL. Our frameworks are Angular.js and Django.</span></p>

                    <p><span class="hidden_content stacks"><br>Of course, just like in everyday life, giving good instructions means knowing how to listen, reflect, and plan too. There are lots of different ways that coders plan out what they are going to build and understand who they are building it for. CFP teaches<b> human-centered design</b> and <b>agile project management</b> as our primary listening and planning tools.</span></p>

                    <p>Code for Progress fellows learn to code starting with the <b>front end</b> and moving towards the <b class="purple_text">back end</b> over 20 weeks. To build apps and sites that work for lots of different communities, they also spend time each week practicing how to see and listen to users and team members by working on real-world <b>community projects</b> through <b>human-centered design</b> and <b>agile project management</b>. Starting with the first day of class, they also do weekly professional development exercises - like resume writing, practice interviews, and job searching.<span class="green_text read_more schedule"> See the weekly schedule...</span></p><br>
