                    <h2>Apply to Code for Progress</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2014, 424 people applied for the Code for Progress fellowship. We expect even more interest this year, and our selection committee will get to know candidates through a two-round process.
                </p>
                <p>Round 1 includes an online application where candidates answer short questions and ask three recommenders to do the same. Candidates who move on to Round 2 will join our staff for two video interviews.
                    </p>
                    <p> Our online application for the 2015 cohort opens in January, and we'll hold information calls once a week while the application period is open.</p>
