                    <p>
                        In 2014, 424 people applied to the Code for Progress fellowship. We expect even more interest in 2015, and our selection committee will get to know candidates through a two-round process.
                </p>
                <p>Round 1 includes an online application where candidates answer short questions and ask three recommenders to do the same. Candidates who move on to Round 2 will join our staff for two video interviews.
                    </p>

                    <p>We'll hold informational calls to answer your questions every Thursday night From February 19 to March 26, from 8-8:30pm Eastern / 5-5:30pm Pacific. To request the dial-in number, please <a class="silver-text" href="http://www.codeforprogress.org/contact">send us a note here</a>.
