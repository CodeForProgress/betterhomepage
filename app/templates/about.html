                    <p>Our year-long fellowship starts with a three to five month (depending on fellows' needs and schedules) residency in Washington DC, where participants are trained in coding and human centered design, and are coached and mentored by talented local professionals. <span class="green_text read_more what_cfp">Read more...</span><span class="hidden_content what_cfp"><br>All Code for Progress fellows receive a monthly stipend and housing allowance during their residency in DC. Then, we facilitate their transition into the tech sector where they use their skills as junior developers, database managers, innovation specialists, and other first coding positions. In the seven-month post-residency period, fellows are supported on the job with weekly check-in calls, ongoing professional mentorship and technical coaching, and opportunities to build new skills.

                    <br><br>By intentionally removing barriers to technological training for women and people of color, Code for Progress cultivates a growing community of diverse professionals who have the technical skills and cultural competency to bring innovation to non-profits, government and industry.</p></span>


                    
                    <br><a name="cfp_why"></a><h3 class='green_text'>Why Code for Progress?</h3>

                    <p>Identifying, recruiting, and training future leaders in technology has primarily fallen to a network of more than 150 nonprofit organizations and private companies. An October 2010 report published by the Association for Computing Machinery and the Computer Science Teachers Association documented the shocking state of computer science education in the U.S.<span class="super">1</span> Only 14 states had adopted significant education standards for high school computer science. Most states focused on basic skills such as keyboarding and using the Internet, rather than high-level concepts needed for 21st century jobs such as understanding and applying algorithmic and computational thinking. <span class="green_text read_more why_cfp">Read more...</span><span class="hidden_content why_cfp">

                    <br>As schools continue to focus funding on subjects recognized as core disciplines, few students have the opportunity to take rigorous, engaging computer science courses, and among those who do, there is little ethnic diversity. According to 2011 data compiled by the College Board on Advanced Placement Computer Science test-takers, only 15% were women, 3% were African American, and 6% were Latino.<span class="super">2</span> Similar issues are apparent in adult education programs that workers depend on to keep them hireable. The Kapor Center for Social Impact recently published a report identifying 153 programs that teach the basics of coding or computer science to both youth and adults.<span class="super">3</span> According to our analysis, of these programs, less than 5% had a stated mission of working with historically underrepresented populations.

                    <br><br>This lack of availability and access to affordable workforce development and technology training for underrepresented communities <a class="presslink" href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/05/29/silicon-valley-tech-diversity-hiring-women-minorities/9735713/">is reflected in the challenges employers report</a> when recruiting tech talent of color.

                    <br><br>In the last few years, coding schools and bootcamps have emerged as a popular and effective way to train technology neophytes and move them into entry-level tech jobs. Unfortunately, many of these programs, with tuition as high as $20,000, are cost-prohibitive. Code for Progress is a unique alternative to for-profit bootcamps--our no-cost, culturally-competent curriculum is custom designed for women and people of color who do not have a background in tech. Our intensive, 5-month coding and human centered design trainings prepare Fellows for careers as technologists, and our 7-months of post-residency support and continuing education ensures that Fellows are successful in their first year on the job.
