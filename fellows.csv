It's as powerful as it sounds.,"Now that I know some of the capabilities of tech, I see digital solutions everywhere for common problems that plague my community. I don't think technology can or should solve everything, but I think useful tools that can be created to help people solve complex problems. Right now, I am especially interested in how Native communities can user mobile technology to learn and grow our diverse histories, languages, cultures, and values.","I went home and taught my mom how to use the command line. She's already started pushing code to her github repository. We do weekly online tutorials together, and I'm super excited to have someone so close to me as a partner and ally in developing digital tools for our community.","Now that I know some of the capabilities of tech, I see digital solutions everywhere for common problems that plague my community.

Mariella,Paulino,"The Bronx, NY","Full-stack developer, Fission Strategy","Being able to create the front end or ""prettification"" of the final community project was an incredible accomplishment for me. It was the perfect manifestation of the transfer from idea to execution of design.","I have a deep appreciation and respect for Python and HTML. The way we interact with something and everything that may be going in the background that we don't see, I think that is something as powerful and interesting.","I see the potential of new software and new technologies in everything. From the moment I open my eyes eyes to the moment I go back to sleep, I have thought of at least 10 new applications I can create in my personal life that would improve how I interact and move around in the world as a woman and as a person with hearing loss. The fact that I could create these applications and create something that would have a positive impact on someone else, I think that is really powerful and empowering.","The last few weeks have been spent job searching. I have already got a few offers but want to make sure that wherever i go next is somewhere where i can contribute my master's in Public Relations, continue to develop tech, and contribute to social activism. A bit of a demanding and picky combination. I am waiting to hear back from my top choice program which combines all three *fingers crossed* so I shall see what happens.","I see the potential of new software and new technologies in everything.

Aurea,Martinez,"Costa Mesa, CA","Organizer, Detention Watch Network",Spinning world map/globe using D-3,HTML & CSS,My goal is to continue working on my app that I started developing in the program and I want to pass the knowledge and help others learn to code and encourage people to code and support CFP to take over the world..jk...to keep growing!,Visited family & friends in California. Ate homemade food and enjoyed the beach life!,"One issue that I want to address is finding people after they have entered the deportation system. It is very hard for family members to track them down, because they are constantly moved from one center to the next. Also, families don't know where to find resources or legal representation for their loved ones.
Though ICE already has a website to locate these people, I want to make a more people-friendly tool that will include both government data and updates from social media. I want to provide information on trusted lawyers, bail bonds, how to get a hearing and community resources or organizations that are able to help families get their loved ones out of detention centers.",aureamartinez
Elaine,Kamlley,"Brooklyn, NY","Innovation Specialist, 18F",Building an MVP of ProgressCRM's Reporting Application. I felt incredible to see it integrated into the larger project.,"Seriously, Python can crunch some numbers, scrape a document, and handle some intense data. Its no wonder coding feels like magic because when I get it to work, I may or may not have called myself a wizard. Please call me out if you have heard me say this.","I am a coder. In just four months Code For Progress given me the tools to build dynamic web applications. What I have been able to accomplish is beyond measure! I have built a data reporting application for a constituent relationship manager, written python scripts that cleans data and exports to a CSV, and can even make a button change colors just by hovering over it.

They haven't visited me since I moved to Brooklyn from the Bay Area two and half years ago. We ate our way through neighborhoods, used our elbows in crowds of tourists, and took many clich√© photos.

Jason,Towns,"Washington, DC",,Getting an opportunity to teach some of the skills that I've developed in Code for Progress to young people at the #YesWeCode youth hackathon was an amazing experience for me.,"One, Python has a strong on and offline support community. There are tons of resources & meetup groups.
Two, Python has a really wide range of use cases - from scientific research to web design. So, the chances of someone out there having some experience doing whatever you're trying to do are pretty high.
Three, Python is (relatively) easy to learn. Had to throw the relatively in there because it's not easy but it is easier to grasp than most other programming languages.","The last four months have really just solidified my feeling that the world is changing... quickly.
There are some really exciting new ways to work, think and build & certain communities just aren't getting access to that. 
I'm dedicated to helping to build that bridge because if we don't do it now, we're going to regret it in the future. So, getting clarity on that has been dope.

Angie,Brilliance,"Chicago, IL","Data coordinator, AFSCME",,,,,"Mass Incarceration is enslaving people of color at disproportionate rates. The prison industrial complex has created a profitable system that is funneling our people from schools, foster care, hospitals and other institutions into the prison system. We have to deconstruct this system because it is unjust, corrupt and purely for the profit of the corporations invested. There are more restorative and transformative alternatives to policing and incarceration.
[I want to build an] app that would reduce the flow into the prison system by helping us to navigate the way that we interact with police on the streets. This app would give you a full understanding of each one of your rights as a youth, person of color, or member of the lgbtq community. It would also give you a direct number to the nearest free defense legal aid available in your area and a pre filled form of emergency information.",angiebrilliance
Katherine,Ortiz,"Brooklyn, NY",,,,,,"A problem that affects my community of Red Hook is repairs that need to be done in the apartments of public housing. Months go by and NYCHA doesn't respond to repair requests. It creates the feeling that the housing authority doesn't care about us, the tenants, so much so that we feel we can‚Äôt take pride in our community. By addressing this communication issue, peoples‚Äô apartments will be more livable and the community can feel heard. I want to make tools that allow public housing residents to report issues and contact maintenance.",kittylee
